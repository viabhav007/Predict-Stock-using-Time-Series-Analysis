# Predict-Stock-using-Time-Series-Analysis
Lets say on this particular day you have this stock and what exactly is the previous closing price, opening price, highest price, lowest price,
last price etc. These are all independent features and apart from this we have to predict what will be the volume weighted average price with
respect to all other independent features. Here we are making using of rolling window concept where we compare the value of stock on the
previous 2-3 days to predict the future value. We made use of ARIMA model where auto ARIMA was used as a correlation function to
compute the p,d,q values.
